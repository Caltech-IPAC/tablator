Tablator is built with waf

  https://github.com/waf-project/waf

Waf is written in python and included in the source tree.  Usage is
very similar to the GNU autotools.  Specifically, you configure
tablator with the command

  ./waf configure

For a list of command line options

  ./waf configure --help

Once configured, build with the command

  ./waf

and install with the command

  ./waf install
